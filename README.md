Indoor localization and navigation using BLE RSSI dataset with machine learning models for position estimation

# Indoor Localization Using BLE RSSI

## Overview
This project focuses on **indoor localization and navigation** using **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons** and **Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data**. We leverage **machine learning models** to estimate position based on BLE signals.

## Dataset ðŸ“‚
- **BLE RSSI Dataset** from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/435/ble-rssi-dataset-for-indoor-localization-and-navigation)
- Alternatively, download it from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mehdimka/ble-rssi-dataset.

## Implementation ðŸš€
- **Preprocessing:** Feature scaling, handling missing data, exploratory analysis.
- **Models Used:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

## Results ðŸ“Š
- **Best Performing Model:** Decision Tree Regressor (Accuracy: 99.76%)
- **Other Models:** Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR)
